        <h1 id="step-1">History</h1>

        <p class="step-2">For many years, there was a legend that Golden Retrievers were
        descended from Russian sheepdogs bought from a circus. In fact, the
        breed was developed in Scotland, at the highland estate of Sir
        Dudley Majoribanks, later known as Lord Tweedmouth.</p>

        <p class="step-3">Tweedmouth, like many gentry of his day, bred animals of all kinds,
        trying to perfect different breeds. Tweedmouth's breeding records
        from 1835 to 1890 show what he was aiming for with the <span>Golden: A
        talented retriever</span> — Tweedmouth was an ardent waterfowl hunter —
        with a superb nose, who would be more attentive to his human hunting
        companion than the setters and spaniels used at the time for
        retrieving. He also wanted the dog to be loyal and even-tempered in
        the home.</p>

        <p id="step-4">Tweedmouth took Nous home to Scotland, and in 1868 and 1871, bred him
        to Belle, a Tweed Water Spaniel. Tweed Water Spaniels (now extinct)
        were known for being eager retrievers in the hunting field, and
        exceptionally <span>calm and loyal</span> in the home — characteristics you'll
        find in today's Golden Retrievers.</p>

        <p class="step-5">Nousand Belle's descendants were bred with Wavy- and Flat-coated
        retrievers, another Tweed Water Spaniel, and a red setter.
        Tweedmouth kept mostly the yellow puppies to continue his breeding
        program, and gave others away to friends and relatives.</p>

        <p id="step-6">Not surprisingly, Tweedmouth's breed first attracted attention for
        their skills in the hunting field. One of the most well-known was
        Don of Gerwyn, <span>a liver-coated descendent</span> of one of Tweedmouth's
        dogs, who won the International Gundog League trial in 1904.</p>
