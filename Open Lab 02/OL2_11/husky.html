            <p>The graceful, medium-sized Siberian Husky’s almond-shaped eyes can be either brown or blue—and sometimes one of each—and convey a keen but amiable and even mischievous expression. Quick and nimble-footed, Siberians are known for their powerful but seemingly effortless gait. Tipping the scales at no more than 60 pounds, they are noticeably smaller and lighter than their burly cousin, the Alaskan Malamute. In fact, breeders and fanciers prefer the moniker Siberians over huskies, as the latter suggests a bigger, brawnier dog than what is the standard for the breed.</p>
            <p>As born pack dogs, Siberians enjoy family life and get on well with other dogs; their innate friendliness render them indifferent watchdogs. This breed is also energetic and can’t resist chasing small animals, so secure running room is a must. An attractive feature of the breed: Siberians are naturally clean, with little doggy odor.</p>
